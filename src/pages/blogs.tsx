  description:
    "Resident Evil Village is a direct sequel to 2017's Resident Evil 7, but takes a very different direction to its predecessor, namely the fact that this time round instead of fighting against various mutated zombies, youâ€™re now dealing with more occult enemies like werewolves and vampires.",
